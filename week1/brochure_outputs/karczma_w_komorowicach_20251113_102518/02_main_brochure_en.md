## Meet Your New Favorite Hangout  
Nestled in the heart of Bielsko-Biała, Karczma w Komorowicach is not just a restaurant — it's a rustic, wooden-beamed, stone-walled *karczma* packed with hearty góralski spirit. Imagine cozy fires crackling, candlelight flickering, and traditional mountain music setting the mood as you feast like a true Juhas (that’s mountain shepherd-speak for a very happy customer).

With room for 120 merry guests, two distinct halls (including *Zbójnicka* — the hall that’s just begging for a dance party), and a warm, authentic mountain vibe, this is THE place to throw any bash — weddings, communions, Silvester Countdown parties, corporate gatherings (yes, business can be fun!), and all things festive in between.

## The Food  
Time to loosen those belts! Our kitchen serves up regional Polish delights, made to satisfy from the simplest appetite to the most refined gourmand palate. Dive into:

- **Buła po komorowicku** – A toasted bun loaded with your choice of crispy schabowy (pork cutlet), chicken, or even vegetarian camembert or fish, all garnished with fresh veggies and perfect garlic sauce. Served with golden fries that crunch with pride.  
- Traditional soups that warm your soul and specialties that carry the mountain air with every bite.  
- A menu that caters to vegetarians, kids, and even picky in-laws.   
- Daily specials so fresh, your taste buds will think they’re on vacation.  

Oh, and don’t forget the *liquid courage*: a fine selection of drinks and local spirits to keep the celebrations flowing.
